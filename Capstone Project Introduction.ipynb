            "source": "London is a major global city and world cultural capital, with strengths in the arts, commerce, education, entertainment, fashion, finance, healthcare, media, professional services, research and development, tourism, and transportation. A major settlement for 2,000 years, London is the world's largest financial centre and the 5th or 6th richest city in the world. The property investment capital of the UK, London has a diverse array of housing and communities across a giant urban area. You can find different types of long-let investment property in various areas to suit most budgets, and being the world's most-visited city as measured by international arrivals means there is no shortage of short-let opportunities too. Having the largest concentration of higher education institutes in Europe guarantees that London has an active student property rental market as well.\n\nThe above reasons constitute London one of the most expensive places for someone to live.Demand for housing and real estate continues to be robust despite Brexit uncertainty.While it is clear that the UK Parliament wishes to avoid a no-deal Brexit, there is little consensus about what form a future arrangement with the EU should take.\n\nThe main objective of this survey is to examine what factors influence most the price of a real estate assets and which houses will be less inelastic to demand should a No deal Brexit occurs.How can the surroundings venues influence the price of the asset and in what extend?Which factor has the larger influence on the price of the asset?\nThe above survey will help real estate investors to focus on regions that have surrounding venues and amenities that drive the price of the housing up.Therefore,should Brexit occur,their losses will be minimum in terms of asset devaluation."
